# Future Founder Predictor

A playful web app that helps kids (and adults) figure out what to do with their lives.  
Spoiler: it always says **“Apply to YC Fall [year] batch.”**

Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** — deployed via **Vercel**.

**Live demo:** [https://what-should-i-do-khaki.vercel.app/](https://what-should-i-do-khaki.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 Overview

This project started as a learning experiment:  
how to take a small, funny idea and turn it into a real, polished web app.

Along the way, it became a sandbox for practicing front-end craft — from component logic to animation and deployment.

The result: a minimal interface with wit, motion, and dark-mode flair.

- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, gradient-driven styling
- **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions and playful feedback
